## 📘 About the Project

This project was developed during my internship at **FERNUS**, an educational technology company.

FERNUS Studio lacked a tool for extracting **Tables of Contents (ToC)** from book screenshots. This project automates that process using AI, replacing the manual and time-consuming methods.
